## What is the Problem Set ?

The CSES Problem Set is a collection of algorithmic programming problems.

The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive high quality problem set for learning algorithmic programming. The current collection has 300 problems, and new problems will be gradually added.

- **Languages**

You can solve problems in several languages, including C++, Java, and Python. More information about available languages is here.

- **Hacking**

After solving a problem, you can view the solutions by other users and try to hack them by giving a test case where the solution fails. Then, the new test case can be added to the test data and all submissions will be regraded.

- **Books**

You can use the problem set together with recent competitive programming books, listed here. The books discuss techniques and ideas that are useful when solving the problems.
